    "abstract": "Engineering team are stuck between a rock and a hard place when it comes to observability: either collect all the data on how your system is behaving or risk not having that one thing needed during an incident. Grepr acts as a proxy between your observability agents and your observability vendor and uses real-time ML to understand the behavior of every piece of data. Grepr's Intelligent Data Engine automatically reduces noise, while keeping all the original raw data in low-cost storage, automatically handling new usage patterns or spikes. The result: minimal configuration, immediate 90% reduction in costs, with no migrations needed. Learn how Grepr works and see it in action in this session.

    "abstract": "This session covers the application of an agentic workflow, leveraging Amazon Bedrock Agent and Amazon Nova, to optimize a common SAP process: vendor invoice processing. Traditional SAP invoice handling often involves manual data entry, error-prone matching, and approval bottlenecks. By integrating Amazon Textract for intelligent document processing and Bedrock's large language models for reasoning, an agentic solution can automate data extraction, verification, discrepancy handling, and approval routing. This results in reduced manual effort, improved accuracy, faster processing times, lower costs, and enhanced visibility within the SAP environment, ultimately fostering stronger vendor relationships.",

Using Amazon Bedrock, you'll first build an agent to monitor ServiceNow for part replenishment requests. Next, you'll develop another agent that converts these tickets into Purchase Requisitions (PR). A web controller agent will then be created to handle PR distribution across your supplier network. Finally, you will create an agent that generates Purchase Orders (PO) based on supplier quotations and predetermined guidelines. You'll walk away with practical experience creating multi-agent workflows that effectively orchestrate business functions across enterprise applications.",

In this session, you will learn how to create meaningful and hyper-personalized customer experiences with Amazon Nova Sonic and design patterns to enable new use cases. You will discover how Amazon Nova Sonic's tool use and function calling capabilities enable integration with external APIs and internal and external data sources to provide context that makes for delightful voice-based customer interactions.",

    "abstract": "Intelligence vs. knowledge is a vital consideration for current AI models. While these models possess the intelligence to solve complex, PhD-level mathematical problems, they require more extensive knowledge to enhance real-world applicability. For instance, despite their advanced calculation abilities, they may not be aware of current market prices for items like Nike shoes. To bridge this gap, models must access real-time data and information. By doing so, they can incorporate accurate, timely details into their mathematical frameworks, improving both their decision-making capabilities and practical implementation across various domains. This synergy between intelligence and knowledge will redefine AI's potential. This presentation is brought to you by Bright Data, an AWS Partner.",

    "abstract": "Traditional SIEM architectures tightly coupled data storage and threat detection, often leading to high costs, slower queries, and limited flexibility. In this session, learn how to reimagine your SIEM design by decoupling detection from storage using Amazon S3. Discover how to keep AWS-native logs in S3 while centralizing additional telemetry, such as endpoint detection and response (EDR) events, in the same buckets. Explore how this approach improves incident response readiness, enables faster queries at lower cost, and supports threat hunting and detection across diverse data sources without moving logs outside AWS.

    "abstract": "Benchmarks drive LLM development decisions, yet their signals are fundamentally fragile due to theoretical limitations critical at scale. Current evaluation spans pointwise metrics, pairwise preferences (Arena, MT-Bench), and agentic evaluations, extending to multi-modal models and autonomous agents. Large-scale evaluation reveals scores shift with decoding parameters, prompt templates, seeds, and inference precision, showing evaluation signals lack mathematical stability. Public benchmarks suffer contamination and memorization that corrupt capability measurement, while pairwise methods inherit systematic biases. This talk examines evaluation paradigm limitations, explores contamination detection methods, and presents frameworks separating genuine capability from benchmark artifacts.",
